                                        the American College of Gastroenterology AGA guidelines for the
                                        management of pouchitis and other pouch related disorders (Olleik
                                        et al., Gastroenterology, Vol. 164, No. 6, 2023).


                                        The European Crohn s and Colitis Organization (ECCO) has included
                                        the De Simone Formulation in its guidelines for the management of
                                        Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IBD) (ECCO, ECCO News, 2023).

                                        CDS22-formula is highly effective in the dietary management of
                                        various gastrointestinal conditions. The extensive scientific evidence,
                                        comprising over 200 peer reviewed articles and more than 80
                                        controlled clinical studies, ensures that the benefits observed in
                                        clinical trials are replicable in everyday use</p>

                    <p class="text-section-p">Not all probiotics are the same. The overall biological action of a probiotic is not
                                        simply the sum of its individual components actions but the result of a complex
                                        network of relationships between the microorganisms it contains and the human
                                        host. Unlike many other products on the market, the clinical results obtained
                                        from CDS22-formula speak louder than any technical description.
                                        CDS22-formula combines 8 bacterial strains selected for their biochemical and
                                        enzymatic profiles and specifically calibrated in precise proportions to
                                        synergistically act on the physiology of the human gastrointestinal tract.

                                        It is crucial to emphasize that the production of the Formulazione De
                                        Simone falls
                                        within the field of biology, not chemistry, as the bacteria forming the product

                                        base are living organisms. Their cultivation requires advanced scientific
                                        knowledge and specific know-how, still protected by industrial secrecy
                                        The unique and advanced know-how developed by Prof. Claudio De Simone,
                                        which includes specific industrial secrets, contributes to the uniqueness and
                                        efficacy of CDS22-formula, making it extremely difficult for others to replicate
                                        or
                                        produce an identical or functionally equivalent product.

                                        Supported by solid scientific evidence, CDS22-formula is highly effective in the
                                        dietary management of dysbiosis and other gastrointestinal conditions, offering

                    <p class="container3-p">The De Simone Formulation is comprised of <span class="highlight">8</span> strains of lactic acid bacteria and bifidobacteria. It was pioneered by Professor Claudio De Simone, MD, PhD, who conducted numerous approaches to intestinal health by introducing the use of high concentration probiotic mixtures to favorably manage diverse and significant gastrointestinal conditions.</p>
            
                    <p class="container3-p">His interest in this important scientific area dates back to the <span class="highlight">1980s</span> when the importance of the intestinal flora’s role was just beginning to be understood. Professor De Simone is a former member of the American College of Gastroenterology and, after graduating in Medicine and Surgery, specialized in gastroenterology, allergy, and clinical immunology. He taught at several Universities in the US and Europe.</p>
            
                    <p class="container3-p">He has published over <span class="highlight">400</span> scientific studies, reviews, and publications.</p>
            
                    <p class="container3-p">Over <span class="highlight">20</span> years ago, the now-known De Simone Formulation, or the <span class="highlight">SLAB51</span>, was extensively studied for better regulation and quality control of production, stability, and efficacy. All of these studies were conducted by Professor De Simone.</p>
            
                    <p class="container3-p">As evidenced by Professor De Simone’s numerous references and publications, many marketed products have not been clinically assessed in man nor investigated for species, strain or dose. Some have caused leading international differences in the safety and efficacy of the final product. De Simone’s work has been published in peer-reviewed journals.</p>
            
                    <p class="container3-p">Current regulations often do not include specific requirements to establish that therapies for managing constipation demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the commercially sold probiotic products.</p>

                    <p class="container3-p">To this point, the De Simone Formulation and under the brand name <span class="highlight">VSL#3<sup>®</sup></span>, was manufactured and sold for over a decade in the US, Canada and Europe by Sigma-Tau Pharmaceuticals, Inc.</p>
            
                    <p class="container3-p">In <span class="highlight">2016</span>, VSL#3’s then-owner was found guilty of false advertising by a New York Federal Judge. (Ruling: Rimini, Merck KGaA, Schering-Plough, VSL Pharmaceuticals, Records). The European Courts and Canadian Courts (CCO) have upheld this guilty ruling that there is a difference between the De Simone Formulation and the new VSL#3<sup>®</sup> formula. This ruling is based on the scientific evidence and on the fact that the new VSL#3<sup>®</sup> does not contain the De Simone Formulation. (See the “Court Cases” section on this website for copies of the Court Orders and PDF’s).</p>
